  # Music Recognition using Fourier Transform (from Scratch)
Spring 2021

Welcome to the Music Recognition project! This software utilizes the power of Fourier Transform, combined with concepts from signals and systems science, to identify the songs to which individual pieces of music belong. Similar to popular applications like Shazam, this code allows you to analyze audio samples and recognize the corresponding songs accurately.

## Background

Music recognition has become an essential feature in today's digital age. With the abundance of music available, users often encounter situations where they hear a song but are unable to identify its title and artist. This code provides a solution by leveraging the power of the Fourier Transform, a mathematical technique used to analyze signals in the frequency domain.

## How it Works

The music recognition algorithm implemented in this code follows these key steps:

1. **Audio Preprocessing**
2. **Fourier Transform**
3. **Spectrogram Generation**
4. **Feature Extraction**
5. **Song Matching**
6. **Song Identification**

## Limitations

Although the Fourier Transform-based approach for music recognition is effective, it does have certain limitations:

- Performance may vary depending on the quality of the input music, presence of noise, and the similarity of the music database.
- Recognition accuracy may be affected by variations in pitch, tempo, or instrumental arrangements within a song.
- This code may not recognize songs that are not present in the reference music database.
- Large music databases may require significant computational resources and time for recognition.

## Acknowledgements

This code was inspired by the work of Shazam and the numerous research papers on music recognition using Fourier Transform. We would like to express our gratitude to the researchers and developers who have contributed to the field of music recognition.

Enjoy recognizing your favorite songs with this code!
